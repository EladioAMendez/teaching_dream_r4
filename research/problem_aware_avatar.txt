### **Stage of Awareness: Problem Aware**

This individual knows they have a problem, but they do not yet know that a solution exists. They are acutely aware of the pain, frustration, and negative consequences of their problem. They are actively seeking relief but are not yet aware of the specific category of solution you provide (e.g., they know they're struggling to study, but they haven't started looking for an "AI Study Partner"). Your marketing goal is to connect with their pain, show them you understand it deeply, and then introduce the new opportunity or a new mechanism for solving it.

### **A → Who Are They:**

*   **Name:** Jessica Miller
*   **Gender:** Female
*   **Job:** Full-time student in her final year of an Elementary Education program. She is currently a student teacher (unpaid) at a local public elementary school three days a week and works 15-20 hours a week as a barista at a campus coffee shop to cover living expenses.
*   **Household Income:** ~$18,000/year. This is a combination of her part-time job and some financial support from her family. She is on a very tight budget, tracking every dollar and relying on student loans for tuition.
*   **Marital Status:** Single. She lives alone in a small, off-campus apartment.
*   **Education Level:** In her final semester, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. She has a respectable GPA (3.4) but has always considered herself a "hard worker" rather than a "naturally smart" person.

### **B → What They Do & Like:**

*   **Top 3 Brands they wear:**
    1.  **Target (Universal Thread, A New Day):** This is her go-to for affordable, professional-looking clothes for student teaching and comfortable basics. She appreciates the style-to-cost ratio.
    2.  **Old Navy:** She stocks up on essentials like pixie pants and cardigans during their sales. It's practical and durable enough for a classroom environment.
    3.  **Hydro Flask:** A non-clothing brand, but it's a core part of her identity. It's always with her, covered in stickers from her university, the local school district, and an "It's a good day to teach" decal. It represents her commitment to her future career and a sense of belonging.

*   **1-2 Hobbies they have:**
    1.  **Journaling/Scrapbooking:** This is her primary way to de-stress and process her thoughts. She meticulously documents her student-teaching journey, pasting in notes from students, photos of classroom projects, and reflections on her lessons. It's a creative outlet that also reinforces her identity as a future teacher.
    2.  **Yoga/Walking:** She tries to do a 20-minute YouTube yoga session (Yoga with Adriene) in the morning to center herself or take a long walk around campus in the evening to clear her head, especially after a frustrating study session.

*   **Top 5 Favorite movies:**
    1.  *Freedom Writers*: The ultimate inspirational teacher movie for her. It represents the impact she dreams of making.
    2.  *Hidden Figures*: She loves stories about overcoming immense, systemic challenges through intelligence and perseverance.
    3.  *Inside Out*: As an elementary education major, she is fascinated by the way it visualizes complex emotions, and she often thinks about it when dealing with her students.
    4.  *The Notebook*: A comfort movie for a cozy night in when she feels overwhelmed and needs a predictable, emotional escape.
    5.  *Mean Girls*: Her go-to for mindless, quotable humor that reminds her of a simpler time.

*   **Top 5 Favorite books:**
    1.  *The Freedom Writers Diary* by Erin Gruwell: The book version of her favorite movie, which she finds even more powerful and authentic.
    2.  *Atomic Habits* by James Clear: She bought this hoping to build better study habits, but ironically, she feels too overwhelmed to implement its systems properly, which adds to her frustration.
    3.  *Where the Crawdads Sing* by Delia Owens: A book club pick she genuinely loved for its story of resilience and isolation.
    4.  *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*: Pure escapism and comfort. It reminds her of the magic of reading that she wants to inspire in her own students.
    5.  *Teach Like a Champion* by Doug Lemov: A required textbook that she genuinely finds insightful, but also intimidating. It sets a high bar that she fears she can't reach.

*   **Top 5 visited websites:**
    1.  **Pinterest:** Her primary source for lesson plan ideas, classroom decoration themes, and anchor chart designs. It's both a tool and a form of aspirational procrastination.
    2.  **Teachers Pay Teachers:** She spends hours searching for worksheets, activities, and curriculum resources, often looking at the free options or agonizing over a $5 purchase.
    3.  **Her University's Online Portal (e.g., Canvas/Blackboard):** She has to check it daily for assignments, grades, and announcements. It's a constant source of low-grade stress.
    4.  **Quizlet:** She has created dozens of digital flashcard sets for her FTCE prep, but finds the process of rote memorization tedious and ineffective for deeper concepts.
    5.  **Google:** Her search history is a direct reflection of her pain: "how to pass FTCE general knowledge math," "FTCE professional education test anxiety," "best way to study for FTCE when you work," "what happens if you fail the FTCE."

*   **Top 5 relevant social media influencers:**
    1.  **Pocketful of Primary (Michelle):** She follows her on Instagram for classroom organization tips and a glimpse into the life of a "perfect" teacher. It's both inspiring and demoralizing.
    2.  **Mr. D Math (Dennis DiNoia):** A friend recommended his FTCE math bootcamps. She’s looked at the website, but the high price point ($200+) is a major barrier, so she just watches his free YouTube videos, which help a little but don't solve her core problem.
    3.  **TeacherGoals:** She follows this account for the relatable and humorous memes about teaching. It makes her feel seen and less alone in her day-to-day struggles.
    4.  **Bored Teachers:** Similar to TeacherGoals, it provides comic relief and a sense of community.
    5.  **A local teacher blogger:** A teacher in her district has a small but active Instagram account. Jessica trusts her recommendations and insights because they feel authentic and locally relevant.

### **C → Why Are They:**

*   **Main Personality Traits:** Diligent, Empathetic, Anxious, People-Pleaser, and slightly overwhelmed. She has a huge heart and a genuine passion for teaching, but her diligence sometimes turns into perfectionism, which fuels her anxiety. She desperately wants to do well and make her professors, family, and future students proud.
*   **5 Major Values They Hold:**
    1.  **Helping Others:** Her core motivation. She believes education is the most powerful way to lift people up.
    2.  **Community:** She wants to create a warm, inclusive classroom community and be part of a supportive school faculty. The isolation of studying is in direct conflict with this value.
    3.  **Diligence:** She believes that hard work is the key to success and is willing to put in the hours, which makes it even more frustrating when her efforts aren't producing results.
    4.  **Kindness:** She believes in treating everyone with patience and understanding, yet she struggles to show that same kindness to herself when she fails.
    5.  **Stability:** She craves the stability of a full-time teaching contract, a steady salary (even a modest one), and a predictable daily routine. This test is the only thing standing in her way.
*   **2 Major Life Victories:**
    1.  **Getting accepted into the College of Education:** It was the moment her dream felt real, a validation of all her hard work in her first two years of college.
    2.  **Connecting with a "difficult" student during her practicum:** She was assigned a student who was withdrawn and struggled with reading. Over several weeks, she found a way to connect with him through graphic novels, and his improvement was the most rewarding experience of her life, confirming she was in the right profession.
*   **2 Major Life Failures:**
    1.  **Failing her first big college chemistry exam:** In her freshman year, she studied for weeks but still failed, which created a deep-seated fear of standardized tests and the belief that she's "bad at tests" no matter how hard she studies. This trauma is being reactivated by the FTCE.
    2.  **Receiving a critical evaluation on a student-teaching lesson:** A few weeks ago, her supervising teacher noted that her explanation of a math concept was "confusing for students." The feedback was constructive, but it hit her hard, feeding her insecurity that she doesn't know the content well enough and won't be an effective teacher.

### **D → Smart Market Questions**

*   **What keeps them awake at night, eyes open, staring at the ceiling:** The looping thought: "What if I fail the FTCE?" This question spirals into more specific fears: "What if I can't get certified? Will I have to delay graduation? What will I tell my parents? I've spent so much money and time on this degree... will it all be for nothing? What if I'm just not cut out for this?" She visualizes the "FAIL" screen on the computer at the testing center.
*   **What are they secretly afraid of in life:** Imposter syndrome. She is terrified that she's not actually smart enough or capable enough to be a good teacher. She fears that one day, everyone—her principal, her students' parents, the students themselves—will discover she's a fraud who doesn't really know what she's doing. The FTCE feels like the first big test of this, and she's afraid it will expose her.
*   **What are they angry about, and who are they angry at:** She's angry at the FTCE itself—this impersonal, high-stakes, standardized barrier that feels disconnected from the reality of being a good, caring teacher. She's angry at the faceless entity that created a test where the math questions feel like trick questions and the professional education scenarios are ambiguously worded. She's also angry at her expensive textbook, whose explanations are dense and unhelpful. And deep down, she's angry at herself for not being able to just "get it."
*   **Top 3 frustrations they feel every day:**
    1.  **The Study Wall:** The experience of getting a practice question wrong, reading the one-paragraph explanation in the back of the book, and still not understanding *why* her answer was wrong or *why* the correct answer is right. It feels like hitting a brick wall with no way around it.
    2.  **Time Scarcity:** The constant, draining feeling of not having enough time. Juggling student teaching, her barista job, coursework, and FTCE prep means something always suffers. She feels guilty when she's working because she's not studying, and she feels guilty when she's studying because she's not preparing her lessons for her students.
    3.  **Isolation:** Studying alone in her apartment is profoundly lonely. There's no one to turn to at 10 PM to ask a quick question. Her friends are either in different majors or have already passed the test, and she feels embarrassed to keep asking them for help.
*   **Biggest secret desire in life:** To walk into the testing center on exam day with a quiet, unshakeable confidence. To sit down, take a deep breath, and feel completely prepared for whatever comes her way. The desire isn't just to pass, but to feel *capable* and *deserving* of passing.
*   **Built-in bias to how they make decisions:** She is biased toward **peer recommendations and proven methods.** She's skeptical of "quick fixes" or overly techy solutions she doesn't understand. She would rather use a well-known (even if ineffective) textbook than a new, unproven app. She needs a low-risk way to try something, like a free trial or a recommendation from someone she trusts (a professor, a friend who passed).
*   **Common words or language unique to them:** "Competencies," "GK Math," "Prof Ed," "Subject Area Exam," "ESOL," "lesson planning," "classroom management," "anchor chart," "scaffolding," "differentiation," "I just hit a wall," "The explanation in the book is useless."
*   **Top 3 complaints about existing solutions:**
    1.  **Practice Tests are just a verdict, not a teacher:** "They tell me I'm wrong, but they don't explain it in a way I can actually understand. What's the point of knowing I got 15/40 on the math section if I don't know how to fix it?"
    2.  **Textbooks are dry and passive:** "Reading a 400-page review book is like trying to drink from a firehose. I can't absorb it all, and when I get stuck on a concept, I just have to reread the same confusing paragraph over and over."
    3.  **Study groups are inefficient:** "It's so hard to get everyone's schedules to line up. And when we do meet, we end up getting off-topic or one person dominates the conversation. It's not a reliable way to get my specific questions answered."

### **E → Going Deep**

*   **Top 3 Dominant Negative Emotions:**
    1.  **Anxiety:** A constant, low-grade hum of dread about the test and her future.
    2.  **Frustration:** A sharp, pointed anger at her inability to make progress despite her hard work.
    3.  **Overwhelm:** The feeling of being crushed under the weight of all her responsibilities, with FTCE prep being the heaviest stone.
*   **Top 3 Dominant Positive Emotions From Solving This Problem:**
    1.  **Confidence:** The deep, internal belief in her own knowledge and abilities.
    2.  **Relief:** The massive, soul-deep exhale of finally having the test behind her and her certification secured.
    3.  **Empowerment:** The feeling of taking control of her future and being ready to step into her own classroom as a capable, certified professional.
*   **Top 3 Beliefs They Hold About The World:**
    1.  "If you work hard enough, you should be able to succeed." (This belief is currently being challenged, causing immense cognitive dissonance).
    2.  "Helping children is one of the most important jobs in the world."
    3.  "There is a 'right' way to do things, and I need to find it."
*   **Biggest Lifestyle Desire:** To be able to spend her Sundays planning creative, fun lessons for her first real classroom instead of cramming for a test. She wants to be shopping for classroom decorations, not flashcards. She desires the mental freedom to focus on the part of the job she loves, not the hurdle she hates.

### **F → Purchasing Habits**

*   **Top 3 Decision Triggers:**
    1.  **A looming deadline:** The official test date is 6 weeks away, and the panic is setting in.
    2.  **A rock-bottom practice test score:** She just took a full-length practice test and scored well below passing. The shock and despair create a moment of "I have to do something different, *now*."
    3.  **Social Proof/Pressure:** A classmate mentions passing the FTCE with ease, and when Jessica asks how, it opens the door for her to seek a new solution.
*   **Prior Purchases For This Pain:**
    1.  *FTCE General Knowledge for Dummies* ($25) - Found it condescending and not detailed enough.
    2.  *Barron's FTCE Flash Cards* ($20) - Good for vocabulary, but useless for understanding math processes or situational judgment questions.
    3.  Maybe a cheap, $15 Udemy course on "FTCE Math Basics" that she watched half of and then abandoned because it was just a series of non-interactive videos.
*   **Price Tolerance For Offer:** Very low to moderate. She cannot afford a $200+ tutoring package. A monthly subscription model is much more approachable. **$10-$20 a month feels manageable**, like a few coffees she'd have to give up. The concept of a free trial is extremely appealing as it removes all financial risk.
*   **Time Horizon Of Solution:** Immediate. She needs a solution that can help her *tonight*. She is not looking for a year-long program; she needs to solve this problem within the next 1-3 months.

### **G → Primary Wants**

*   **Wants to gain:** Confidence, a passing score, her teaching certificate, peace of mind.
*   **Wants to be:** A certified teacher, prepared, confident, respected, effective, free from anxiety.
*   **Wants to do:** Start her teaching career, plan engaging lessons, decorate her first classroom, help students learn and grow.
*   **Wants to save:** Time, mental energy, money (by not having to retake the test).
*   **Wants to avoid:** Failing the test, disappointing her family, delaying her career, feeling stupid, wasting her degree.

### **H → Empathy Map**

(Imagine Jessica at 10:30 PM at her small apartment desk after a long day)

*   **Seeing:** Her laptop screen with a Quizlet tab open next to a PDF of a practice test with red 'X's on it. Her thick, intimidating FTCE prep book sitting just to the side. A half-empty coffee mug. The clock ticking closer to midnight. Her phone, lighting up with a friend's unrelated, fun Instagram story.
*   **Thinking:** *"I don't get it. I just don't get it. Why is this so hard? I've read this chapter three times. Am I stupid? I was able to explain long division to a 4th grader today, why can't I figure this out? Everyone else seems to pass this. What if I'm the only one who can't? This is hopeless. There has to be a better way than just... reading and hoping."*
*   **Hearing:** The quiet hum of her refrigerator. The faint sound of traffic outside. In her head, she hears her professor's voice saying, "You must know the content inside and out." She hears her dad's voice asking, "So when's the big test?"
*   **Feeling:** Desperate, defeated, isolated, and intellectually exhausted. A knot of anxiety is tight in her stomach. She feels a wave of self-pity followed by a surge of frustration.
*   **Saying:** (To herself, under her breath) "Ugh, this is useless." "I'm so tired." "Okay, just one more question." (She gets it wrong). "I can't do this tonight. I'll try again tomorrow."
*   **Doing:** Rereading the same confusing explanation in her textbook. Clicking aimlessly between her study tabs. Rubbing her temples. Highlighting a passage that she won't remember tomorrow. Finally, closing her laptop and scrolling through TikTok to numb the feeling of failure.
