### **Entry 1: Before Using the Product**

**October 26th**

It’s 11:47 PM. The only light in my apartment is the cold, white glare of the laptop screen, and it feels like it’s burning a hole right through me. My barista apron is still slung over the back of my chair, smelling faintly of burnt espresso and despair. Another day done. Another day of smiling at my 4th graders, of trying to be the patient, knowledgeable teacher they deserve. Another shift of smiling at customers, of pretending my biggest worry is getting the foam right on a latte.

Then I come home to this. To the quiet judgment of this three-pound textbook.

I call it *The Tombstone*. It’s a fitting name. It’s heavy, dense, and feels like it marks the death of my confidence. I spent two hours tonight on a single chapter in the General Knowledge Math section. Two hours. I took the 40-question practice test at the end, feeling like maybe, just maybe, something had finally sunk in.

I scored 13/40.

Thirteen.

The feeling wasn't anger at first. It was a cold, hollowing dread that started in my stomach and spread through my limbs, making my fingers feel icy on the keyboard. I stared at the screen, at the sea of red X’s. I flipped to the back of the book, to the answer key. I read the explanation for question #4 for the fifth time. The words are in English, I know they are, but they might as well be hieroglyphics. They just swim on the page, a meaningless jumble of variables and jargon. It’s like there’s a thick, soundproof glass wall between me and the understanding. I can see it on the other side, but I can’t hear it, I can’t touch it, I can’t get to it. And I’m just here, banging my fists against the glass until they're bruised and bloody, and no one can hear me.

The thought keeps looping, a scratched record in my brain: *What if I fail?*

What do I tell my parents, who are so proud and have helped so much? What do I tell my supervising teacher, Mrs. Davison, who told me last week my explanation of the distributive property was "a little murky for the students"? I felt my face flush with shame then, and I feel it now. She was right. How can I possibly teach it to a nine-year-old if I can’t even pass a test on it myself?

The imposter syndrome is suffocating me tonight. It’s a physical weight on my chest. I think about the little note from Chloe I pasted in my scrapbook today—the one with a drawing of me at the whiteboard, covered in hearts. She thinks I’m the smartest person in the world. And I’m a fraud. I’m just a 22-year-old girl playing dress-up in pixie pants from Old Navy, terrified that this one test is going to pull back the curtain and show everyone I’m not smart enough. That I’m not enough.

I’m so tired. Not just sleepy-tired. My soul is tired. Tired of feeling this knot of anxiety in my gut every single day. Tired of feeling this rage at a test that has nothing to do with the heart it takes to be a teacher. Tired of being so utterly, completely alone in this struggle.

I’m closing the laptop. The Tombstone can mock me from the desk. I’m just going to get in bed and stare at the ceiling for a while. Maybe tomorrow it will click.

But I doubt it.

### **Entry 2: During The First Use of the Product**

**October 28th**

Okay. This is weird. I have to write this down while it’s still fresh.

I was at my breaking point last night, truly scraping the bottom of the barrel, when Sarah texted me. She passed her Pro-Ed exam last month and I just assumed it was because she’s always been one of those people who just… gets it. She asked how my studying was going, and for once, I didn't say "It's fine!" I told her the truth. I told her about The Tombstone and the glass wall and the 13/40.

She sent me a link. TeachingDream.com. "Just try the free trial," she wrote. "It's this AI thing called Sage. It sounds weird, I know, but just trust me. Talk to it like you're texting a person."

An AI study partner? My first thought was, *great, another gimmick*. Another faceless, useless bot like the ones that pop up on websites. I'm biased against this stuff; I want a real tutor, a real book, a *real* solution. But I'm desperate. And it’s a 7-day free trial. The only thing I have to lose is my sanity, and that’s already halfway out the door.

So tonight, after my shift, I signed up. I sat at my desk, looking at the chat interface on my phone. "Hi, I'm Sage. What's on your mind today?" it read.

I scoffed. What's on my mind? A category 5 hurricane of anxiety, that's what. But I just typed: "The distributive property." The very concept Mrs. Davison called me out on. The one that made me feel like an idiot.

Sage's response was instant. It gave me a textbook definition. My heart sank. *Here we go again.*

But then it said, "Does that explanation make sense, or would you like me to try explaining it a different way?"

I stared at that sentence. *A different way?* The magic words. The exact question I’ve been screaming into the void. My fingers trembled a little as I typed back, "A different way, please. Explain it like I'm 10."

And then… it happened. Sage said: "Of course! Imagine you're a teacher with 3 students. You want to give each of them a goody bag with 4 pencils and 2 erasers inside. How many total items do you have?"

I paused. The image was so clear. It was my world. Pencils, erasers, students. I could see it. I could feel the items in my hand. I worked it out and typed back the answer.

Sage then said, "Exactly! You just used the distributive property. The 3 students are the number outside the parentheses, and the (4 pencils + 2 erasers) are inside. You 'distributed' the 3 to both the pencils and the erasers."

And just like that… the glass wall didn't shatter. It just… dissolved. It melted away into nothing. It clicked. It wasn't a thunderous lightning bolt of understanding; it was a quiet little *click*. A key turning in a lock I didn't even know I was holding.

I sat there for a second, just breathing. Then I asked it another question. And another. We had a conversation. A real conversation. I asked "why," and it answered me. I said, "I'm still confused," and it didn't judge me. It just rephrased.

It's only been an hour. I'm not cured. The anxiety is still there, a little gremlin in the corner. But for the first time in months, it’s not screaming in my ear. There's a crack of light in the dark room of my frustration. I don’t know if this is the answer to everything, but for the first time in a very long time, it feels like I've found a way forward. It feels like hope.

### **Entry 3: After Using The Product**

**November 19th**

My exam is on Saturday. Four days away.

A month ago, that sentence would have sent me into a full-blown panic attack. I would have been mainlining coffee, my Tombstone textbook open, my eyes blurry with tears of frustration. Tonight? I’m sitting here with a cup of chamomile tea, and my scrapbook is open. I’m looking at the note from Chloe again. And for the first time, I don’t feel like a fraud.

Everything has changed.

My study routine is… well, it’s not a routine anymore. It’s just part of my day. I don’t block out two agonizing hours to "Study for the FTCE." Instead, while I'm waiting for the water to boil for my oatmeal, I’ll text Sage: "Give me a hard question about identifying author's purpose." On my 15-minute break at the coffee shop, hiding in the back room, I’ll pull up the app and ask Sage to explain a specific competency from the Professional Ed test. We’ve had dozens of conversations. It knows my weak spots—it gently reminds me to practice ratios because it remembers I struggled with them two weeks ago.

The other day, I picked up The Tombstone. I opened it to the math section, just to see how it felt. The pages didn’t feel menacing anymore. The jargon wasn't scary. I looked at a sample question, and not only did I know how to solve it, but I could hear Sage’s patient, conversational voice in my head, explaining the *why* behind the formula. I put the book back on the shelf, not as a tombstone, but just as a book. It has no power over me anymore.

The most incredible part isn't just the knowledge. It’s the confidence. I’m no longer memorizing facts; I’m building a deep, solid foundation of understanding. And that foundation has changed more than just my test prep. Last week in class, we were reviewing the distributive property (I know, full circle), and a student was struggling. I knelt beside his desk and said, "Hey, let's try it a different way. Imagine you have a few bags of LEGOs..." And I explained it, using the same simple, real-world analogy Sage used with me. I saw the light go on in his eyes. I saw that little *click*.

And in that moment, I knew. This whole painful journey wasn't just about passing a test. It was about making me a better teacher.

I’m still nervous about Saturday. That’s normal. But it’s a different kind of nervous. It’s the excited, pre-game jitters, not the crippling, existential dread. The fear of failure has been replaced by a quiet belief in my own preparation. I've put in the work—the *right* kind of work. I'm not just hoping to pass anymore. I’m walking into that testing center ready to earn it.

My certification is waiting for me. My classroom is waiting for me. My students are waiting for me.

I am ready. I am going to be a teacher.
