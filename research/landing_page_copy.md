**Headline:** See Understanding Happen.

**Content:** Watch Sage in action. Our interactive demo reveals how effortless and effective personalized learning can be. See complex concepts clarify, and your confidence grow with every question answered.

**Visual/Video Suggestion:** A short (1-2 minute) animated video or interactive GIF carousel. It starts with a frustrated Jessica, then transitions to her confidently interacting with Sage on her phone during a short break. Highlight:

*   **The "Ask Anything" Moment:** A quick shot of typing a confusing question (e.g., "distributive property") into the chat. (Microinteraction: Text input with a subtle `typing` animation from 21st.dev.)
*   **The Conversational Explanation:** Show Sage's multi-turn, Socratic dialogue, with text appearing smoothly (MagicUI `fadeInUp` animation).
*   **The "Click" Moment:** A visual representation of understanding – perhaps a lightbulb icon or a subtle `pulseOnCorrect` animation (from the brand's proposed animations) on the screen when a concept is grasped.
*   **Progress Tracking:** A brief glimpse of a clean dashboard (using `shadcn/ui` components) showing progress and identified weak spots.
*   **Anytime, Anywhere:** Show the app being used seamlessly on a mobile device in different contexts.

**Microinteraction:** The video player or GIF carousel itself could have subtle `shimmer` loading states (MagicUI). When a key concept is explained, a small, delightful `pulseOnCorrect` animation could appear on the relevant text or UI element within the simulated app screen. The overall flow should feel smooth and intuitive, reflecting the ease of use.
